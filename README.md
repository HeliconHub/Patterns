### Introduction 🎯

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.
This repository demonstrates how these patterns are implemented in Java, with real-world examples and best practices.
Mastering these patterns will enhance your coding skills and help you design robust applications.

### Creational Patterns 🏗️

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms.
These patterns ensure flexibility and reusability by controlling how objects are instantiated.

1. [ ] Abstract Factory
2. [ ] Builder
3. [ ] Factory
4. [ ] Prototype
5. [ ] Singleton

### Structural Patterns 🧱

Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects to form larger structures.

1. [ ] Adapter
2. [ ] Bridge
3. [ ] Composite
4. [ ] Decorator
5. [ ] Facade
6. [ ] Flyweight
7. [ ] Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns 🔄

Behavioral patterns are concerned with the interaction and communication between objects.

1. [ ] Chain of Responsibility
2. [ ] Command
3. [ ] Iterator
4. [ ] Mediator
5. [ ] Memento
6. [ ] Observer
7. [ ] State
8. [x] [Strategy](https://github.com/HeliconHub/Patterns/tree/main/src/main/java/patterns/io/behavioral/strategy)
9. [ ] Template Method
10. [ ] Visitor


### How to Use This Repo 📂
1. #### Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HeliconHub/Patterns.git
   cd java-design-patterns
   ```
2.  #### Explore Examples:
    Browse the src/main/java/patterns/ directory to view pattern implementations.

3.	#### Run the Code:
      - Use your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) to open the project.
      - Each pattern has a Main.java file for demonstration. Run it to see the pattern in action!
    
4. #### Learn and Apply:
    - Read the README.md file in each pattern folder to understand the pattern.
    - Study the example code and comments to learn how to apply the pattern.
    - Implement the pattern in your projects to write cleaner, more maintainable code.
