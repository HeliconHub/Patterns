# Strategy

### Intent
**Strategy** is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.  
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently of clients that use it.

### Structure

A Strategy pattern consists of the following parts:

* **Context**: The context maintains a reference to one of the concrete strategies and communicates with this object only via the strategy interface. Usually, a context means a class that has a field for storing a reference to one of the strategies.

* **Strategy**: The strategy is an interface (super-type) common to all supported algorithms. It declares a method the context uses to execute a strategy. In practice, the strategy interface usually provides just a single method for executing the algorithm in each concrete strategy class.

* **Concrete Strategies**: These are one or more implementations of the strategy interface. Each concrete strategy implements an algorithm using the strategy interface.

* **Execution**: The context calls the execution method on the linked strategy object each time it needs to run the algorithm. The context doesnâ€™t know what type of strategy it works with or how the algorithm is executed.

* **Client**: The client creates a specific strategy object and passes it to the context. The context exposes a setter which lets clients replace the strategy associated with the context at runtime. In practice, the client is usually a class that contains some business logic that uses the context object and the strategy object to solve a particular problem.


### Applicability
* Use the Strategy pattern when you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.

* Use the Strategy when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.

* Use the pattern to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms that may not be as important in the context of that logic.

* Use the pattern when your class has a massive conditional statement that switches between different variants of the same algorithm.
